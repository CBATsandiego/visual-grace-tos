Privacy Policy
Last updated: February 11, 2026
DailyBibleVerses ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our mobile application DailyBibleVerses (the "App").
Information We Collect
We do not collect, store, or process any personal information from you.
This means we do not collect:

Names, email addresses, phone numbers, or other contact details
User profiles, usernames, or account information
Device identifiers, advertising IDs, IP addresses, or location data
Videos, photos, comments, likes, follows, or any other user-generated content or interactions for our own storage or use
Any analytics, crash reports, usage statistics, or performance data tied to identifiable users

The App is designed to function completely anonymously. Any content you view or interact with (such as Bible verses displayed or favorited) stays on your device only and is not transmitted to or retained by us.
Third-Party Services
The App does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, cloud storage, login services (e.g., Google, Apple Sign In), social sharing SDKs, or other tools that would collect data from users.
If the App uses any platform-provided features (such as iOS or Android system components for basic operation), those are governed by the privacy policies of Apple or Google:

Apple Privacy Policy: https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/
Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

We do not control or receive any data from these platform services.
Children's Privacy
The App is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age in your country). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used the App, please contact us — though no personal data exists for us to delete or review.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the App and updating the "Last updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
